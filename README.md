# pc-builder-app
A website to allow users to buy their dream pc using the industry's highest performing GPUs.

This repository provides a sample e-store for selling gaming PCs, built using [evershop.io](https://evershop.io/), a cloud-based platform for building e-commerce websites. This highly modular and customizable NodeJS ecommerce platform is built with React and MySQL. It is a monolithic application harnessing both REST API and GraphQL API for the frontend/backend communication.
The custom theme of this website `pc-builder` adds static type checking via Typescript to ensure code reliability, maintainability and stronger code organization. Since evershop.io was developed first as a JS application, all theme features developed in Typescript were compiled into JS before each build.

The store features a catalog of gaming PC models, each with its specifications, pricing, and images. Customers can browse the catalog, select a model, and add it to their cart. They can also view their cart, proceed to checkout, and pay using a credit card or other supported payment methods.
